## WorldWise

**WorldWise** is an interactive travel destinations web app originally inspired by *The Ultimate React Course* from Udemy. This project expands on the original by integrating real-world APIs and modern state-management tools to enhance functionality and developer experience.

### 🚀 What’s Improved

* **Map Integration**
  Replaced the original map solution with **Gaode (Amap) Map API** for more accurate and native support in China and Asia-Pacific regions.

* **Mock Backend with Strapi**
  A local headless CMS server is included under the `/server` directory using **Strapi**, providing structured endpoints for destinations, users, and related content.

* **Enhanced Auth with RTK Query**
  The authentication system (registration & login) is completely rebuilt using **Redux Toolkit Query (RTKQ)** for reliable async state handling, caching, and server synchronization.
